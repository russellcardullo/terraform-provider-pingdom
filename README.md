# terraform-provider-pingdom #

This project is a [terraform](http://www.terraform.io/) provider for [pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/).

This currently only supports working with basic HTTP and ping checks.

## Build and install ##

### Using released versions ###

Prebuild releases for most platforms are available [here](https://github.com/russellcardullo/terraform-provider-pingdom/releases).
Download the release corresponding to your particular platform and place in `$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins/[os]_[arch]`.  For instance
on Linux AMD64 the path would be `$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins/linux_amd64`.

After copying the plugin run `terraform init` in your projects that use this provider.

### Dependencies for building from source ###

If you need to build from source, you should have a working Go environment setup.  If not check out the Go [getting started](http://golang.org/doc/install) guide.

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for dependency management.  To fetch all dependencies run `go get` inside this repository.

### Build ###

```
make build
```

The binary will then be available at `_build/terraform-provider-pingdom_VERSION`.

### Install ###

```
make install
```

This will place the binary under `$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins/OS_ARCH/terraform-provider-pingdom_VERSION`.  After installing you will need to run `terraform init` in any project using the plugin.

## Usage ##

**Basic Check**

```
variable "pingdom_user" {}
variable "pingdom_password" {}
variable "pingdom_api_key" {}
variable "pingdom_account_email" {} # Optional: only required for multi-user accounts

provider "pingdom" {
    user = "${var.pingdom_user}"
    password = "${var.pingdom_password}"
    api_key = "${var.pingdom_api_key}"
    account_email = "${var.pingdom_account_email}" # Optional: only required for multi-user accounts
}

resource "pingdom_check" "example" {
    type = "http"
    name = "my http check"
    host = "example.com"
    resolution = 5
}

resource "pingdom_check" "example_with_alert" {
    type = "http"
    name = "my http check"
    host = "example.com"
    resolution = 5
    sendnotificationwhendown = 2
    integrationids = [
      12345678,
      23456789
    ]
    userids = [
      24680,
      13579
    ]
}

resource "pingdom_check" "ping_example" {
    type = "ping"
    name = "my ping check"
    host = "example.com"
    resolution = 1
    userids = [
      24680
    ]
}
```

Apply with:
```
 terraform apply \
    -var 'pingdom_user=YOUR_USERNAME' \
    -var 'pingdom_password=YOUR_PASSWORD' \
    -var 'pingdom_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY'
```

**Using attributes from other resources**

```
variable "heroku_email" {}
variable "heroku_api_key" {}

variable "pingdom_user" {}
variable "pingdom_password" {}
variable "pingdom_api_key" {}

provider "heroku" {
    email = "${var.heroku_email}"
    api_key = "${var.heroku_api_key}"
}

provider "pingdom" {
    user = "${var.pingdom_user}"
    password = "${var.pingdom_password}"
    api_key = "${var.pingdom_api_key}"
}

resource "heroku_app" "example" {
    name = "my-app"
    region = "us"
}

resource "pingdom_check" "example" {
    name = "my check"
    host = "${heroku_app.example.heroku_hostname}"
    resolution = 5
}
```

**Teams**

```
resource "pingdom_team" "test" {
  name = "The Test team"
}
```

**Users**

```
resource "pingdom_user" "first_user" {
  username = "johndoe"
}

resource "pingdom_user" "second_user" {
  username = "janedoe"
}
```

**Contacts**

```

resource "pingdom_contact" "first_user_contact_email_2" {
  user_id        = "${pingdom_user.first_user.id}"
  email          = "john.doe@doe.com"
  severity_level = "LOW"
}

resource "pingdom_contact" "first_user_contact_sms_1" {
  user_id        = "${pingdom_user.first_user.id}"
  number         = "700000000"
  country_code   = "33"
  phone_provider = "nexmo"
  severity_level = "HIGH"
}

resource "pingdom_user" "second_user" {
  username = "janedoe"
}

resource "pingdom_contact" "second_user_contact_email_1" {
  user_id        = "${pingdom_user.second_user.id}"

## Resources ##

### Pingdom Check ###

#### Common Attibutes ####

The following common attributes for all check types can be set:

  * **name** - (Required) The name of the check

  * **host** - (Required) The hostname to check.  Should be in the format `example.com`.

  * **type** - (Required) The check type.  Allowed values: (http, ping).

  * **sendnotificationwhendown** - The number of consecutive failed checks required to trigger an alert. Values of 0 are ignored. See note about interaction with `integrationids` below.

  * **notifyagainevery** - Notify again after n results.  A value of 0 means no additional notifications will be sent.

  * **notifywhenbackup** - Notify when backup.

  * **integrationids** - List of integer integration IDs (defined by webhook URL) that will be triggered by the alerts. The ID can be extracted from the integrations page URL on the pingdom website. See note about interaction with `sendnotificationwhendown` below.

  * **teamids** - List of integer team IDs that will be notified when the check is down.

Note that when using `integrationids`, the `sendnotificationswhendown` value will be ignored when sending webhook notifications.  You may need to contact Pingdom support for more details.  See #52.
